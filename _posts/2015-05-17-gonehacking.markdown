<h1>Trade It Easy</h1>

Learn how to enter the trading industry.

## Inspiration
The aim behind the hackathon was to innovate within the capital markets industry. There were four main topic areas:
1. Data and Analytics 
2. Risk Management 
3. Social Media Sentiment 
4. Employee Gamification

## What it does
Developed a web application for helping young professionals hoping to get into trading stocks. We took historical data from TESCO, a company that most people will be familiar with, and then guided the users through a timeline, asking them to look at relevant newspaper articles and tweets, so that they can make a decision as to whether they would buy, or sell more stocks. If they made the wrong decision, we would try to explain what decision they should have made.

## How we built it
We used Meteor for the first time, making it a lot easier to build a frontend and backend, and get them to communicate with each other which meant we could spend more time on the design of the application.

## What we learned
How to use Meteor to build an application.

## What we won
We won remote control drones for finishing 5th at the event.
