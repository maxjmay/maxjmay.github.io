<h1>Ikaros VR</h1>

A virtual reality application for the airline industry.

## Inspiration
DestinationHack was a hackathon that was focused on travelling, whether it was transport, hotels, things to do. One of the sponsors was an impressive company called TimeLooper, we were very impressed with the VR application, and wanted to try and build a VR solution ourselves.

## What it does
Uses the sweetspot (the time between taking off and landing), by providing passengers with virtual reality options, enhancing their travel experience.

Ikaros VR is a B2B solution which offers a new way of capturing passengers, and brings together airlines and third party suppliers, using virtual reality. It also offers opportunity to gamify the travel experience.

There are two main features of the system:
1. Plan your flight transfer, and buy products from duty free.
2. Try before you buy tours, esapces, museums etc.

## How we built it
We used WebVR to build a web application based VR experience, which means that although we are not using the latest in VR technology that comes with the Oculus Rift for example, but users only need a smartphone to be able to use it.

## What we learned
We had never used WebVR before, so enjoyed using the language and building an immersive VR experience, and hopefully we'll be able to use it again in the future.

## What we won
We won the Virtual Reality Vision Award, presented by TimeLooper, and Most Potential, presented by 33Entrepreneurs.
