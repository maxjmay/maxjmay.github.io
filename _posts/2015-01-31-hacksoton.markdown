<h1>Hackfair</h1>

Hackathon anti-cheat application.

## Inspiration
Our inspiration for the project was to try and stop cheating at hackathons, after a couple of incidents that had occurred at previous events.

## What it does
A simple tool for checking when a GitHub repository was created, when it was last updated, the total number of commits, and the people involved in the project. The main aim of the project is to help hackathon judges to award prizes to projects that have been built by 4 or less people, and developed over the hackathon weekend. It can also be used to put more emphasis on the code created during a hack weekend, and not about ideas, sketches and videos etc. As hackathons get more and more popular, and prizes increase, this will become a more important issue.

## How we built it
The project was built using Node.js, Semantic UI, and an integration with the Github API.

## What I learned
Having mainly been the "frontend" guy at my placement company, I learned a lot about using Node.js as a backend, something that I have used in many hackathons since. Knowing Javascript makes it a lot easier to pickup than another language such as PHP and Python.
