<h1>JustBookkeeping</h1>

Helping charities manager their accounts.

## Inspiration
The aim of the hackathon was to be a "hacker for good"; to solve a local problem, or to aid a charity. We also had to integrate the Paypal / Braintree API.

## What it does
We developed a bookkeeping web application for small organisations and charities who can't afford to spend money on big pieces of software.

## How we built it
We built the application using Nodejs and Angular, and then sponsor APIs such as Braintree, Pushed and SendGrid.

## Challenges we ran into
My teammate forgot his laptop charger so we lost sometime trying to find a nearby shop where he could by a new one. We also encountered a few issues trying to use Pusher for the first time. Pusher is a set of libraries that make it easier to build real-time web applications. This meant that we weren't able to spend as long as we wanted to on the actual design of the application.

## What we learned
To always make sure that we have our laptop chargers, and to come up with backup libraries to use when trying to take on a new sponsor API.
