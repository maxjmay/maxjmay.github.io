<h1>DevBox</h1>

A collaborative development environment.

## Inspiration
The challenge for the hackathon was to use the Dropbox API.

## What it does
We created Dev-Box, an online collaboration IDE, allowing multiple users to connect and edit the same files, while video chatting to each other, using WebRTC.

## How we built it
We used Node.js, Socket.IO and WebRTC. As Heroku were part sponsors of the hackathon, we also used that to host the application.

## Challenges we ran into
The venue for the event was closed on the Friday night, so we spent a lot of time travelling to and from Bracknell, so were very limited to the amount of time we had to develop the project.

## What I learned
I had never used WebRTC before, so I really enjoyed trying to integrate that into the system. I also learned how to use Heroku which became my go-to server for future hackathon projects.
